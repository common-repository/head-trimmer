Customizable plugin to selectively remove WordPress version information, feeds, shortlinks, xmlrpc, emoji support and other miscellaneous extras from the HEAD element.

== Description ==
The **Head Trimmer** plugin for WordPress is a customizable plugin to remove automatically generated information from the HEAD element across a site. These extras add bloat to a website and expose WordPress version information as well as other potential security signatures in the generated source code.

Removal options include:

* WordPress Version
* WordPress Version from URLs for Scripts and Styles
* Shortlink
* Shortlink from HTTP response headers
* Canonical
* Relational Links for Posts Adjacent to Current Post
* RSS Feeds
* Really Simple Discovery Link for xmlrpc (rsd_link)
* Windows Live Writer Manifest File Link (wlwmanifest_link)
* oEmbed Discovery Links
* REST API Link
* REST API Link Header
* Emoji Support
* Global Styles and SVG Filters (duotone filters)
* Gutenberg Block CSS Styles (or set 'should_load_separate_core_block_assets')
* Classic Theme Styles (classic-theme-styles)
* DNS Prefetch for //s.w.org
* DNS Prefetch for Google Fonts //fonts.googleapis.com
* jQuery

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= The setting to remove a particular element is checked. Why do I still find the element in the source? =

Please verify settings for other installed plugins which may re-add an element. As an example, various SEO plugins may include an option to add the canonical or relational links.

= I set the option to remove the WordPress version number from scripts and styles. Why do I still find version numbers in script and style URLs? =

Head Trimmer removes the installed WordPress version number from script and style URLs. It does not remove version numbers generated by other plugins such as caching and optimization plugins.
